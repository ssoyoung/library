# Books Module

## Overview

The `books` module is responsible for handling book-related operations such as:

- Retrieving book information
- Search functionality with pagination
- Sorting
- Future implementation of Create, Update, and Delete operations

## Key Features

- **Search Options**: Allows users to search books with keyword in title or author in case insensitive manner.
- **Pagination**: Enhances performance by loading data in chunks.
- **Sorting**: Provides a better user experience by allowing data sorting.

## Structure and Key Files

- **Repository** (`repository.ts`): Manages database interactions for book data.
- **Controller** (`controller.ts`): Handles HTTP requests and responses for book-related endpoints.
- **Service** (`service.ts`): Contains business logic for book operations.
- **Types** (`types.ts`): Defines the structure of book-related data types.
- **Validation** (`validation.ts`): Validates data for pagination and sort.

## Usage

- Start the server using `npm runstart`.
- Access book-related endpoints via the API.
- View API documentation:
  1. Start the server.
  2. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/api-docs` in your web browser.
  3. Use the Swagger UI to explore and test available endpoints.


## Proposed Improvements
These are the proposed improvements for the Books module.

### Database
1. Implement a proper database system (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) to replace the current JSON file-based storage.
2. Design an efficient schema for book data, including indexes for frequently queried fields.
3. Implement database migrations for version control of the database schema.

### Caching Strategy
1. Cache search results to reduce database load for repeated queries.
2. Implement cache invalidation strategies to ensure data consistency.

### API Enhancement
1. Add rate limiting to prevent API abuse.
3. Implement proper error handling and consistent error responses as a library.
2. Implement API versioning to manage future changes and updates.
   - Use URL versioning (e.g., `/v1/books`, `/v2/books`) for clear separation of API versions.
   - Maintain backward compatibility when introducing new versions.

3. Enhance API data validation:
   - Use a validation library like class-validator for robust input validation.
   - Validate request bodies, query parameters, and path parameters.

### Testing
1. Add test coverage for all new functionalities.
4. Implement performance tests to ensure APIs can handle expected load.

### Security
1. Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.
2. Use HTTPS for API communications.
3. Regular security audits and dependency updates.

### Monitoring and Logging
1. Implement centralized logging.
2. Set up monitoring and alerting for critical system metrics.
